# Diffuse Limited Aggregation Simulator
This app simulates 2D diffusion limited aggregation on open or closed 
topologies using random walks to generate Brownian trees.  

Diffusion limited aggregation occurs when randomly moving particles cluster together 
into aggregates forming (in simulations) 2D fractals.  

## Technologies used
Node, Express, JavaScript, EJS/HTML, and CSS.  

## Improvements
Improved efficiency to reduce rendering load, allowing for larger simulations with more particles.
Generalized functions to enable users to setup and interact with simulations.
